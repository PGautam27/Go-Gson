# Go-Gson
This was a funny project that I made for my own use. There aren't many mobile applications that let's you get the json structure when you put your url.
I used volley library, which is an similar alternative for retrofit client. Volley library had the exact functions that I looked for, StringRequest function. This function pulls up the json structure 
in string format and I appened it with queue. I then display the stringyfied json to the user. This was pretty fun to make, I wanted to add json file download. But haven't written the code yet. I'll do it when I get the jist to do it.

BUT EOD what I wanted the app to do, the app does.
